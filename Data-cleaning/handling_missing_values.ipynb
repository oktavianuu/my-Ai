    "When performing data cleaning or data preprocessing, we might use random operations such as filling in missing values or splitting data into training and test sets.

    "If a value is missing because it does not exist (for example like the height of the oldest child of someone who don't have any children) then it doesn't make sense to try and guess what it might be. These kind of missing values we probably do want to keep as `NaN`. On the other hand, if the values is missing because it was not recorded, then we can try to guess what it might have been based on the other values in that column and row, which we called **imputation**.\n",

(This is generally not a recommended approch for important projects! It's usually worth it to take the time to go through our data and really look at all the columns with missing values one-by-one to really get to know our dataset.)\n",
