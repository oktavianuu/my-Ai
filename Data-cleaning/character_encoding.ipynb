    "## Encoding\n",
    "Character encodings are specific sets of rules for mapping from raw binary byte strings (that look like this: 0110100001101001) to characters that make up human-readable text (like \"hi\"). There are many different encodings, and if we tried to read in text with a different encoding than the one it was originally written in, we ended up with scrambled text called \"mojibake\" (said like mo-gee-bah-kay). Here's an example of mojibake:\n",
    "\n",
    "æ–‡å—åŒ–ã??\n",
    "\n",
    "We might also end up with a \"unknown\" characters. There are what gets printed when there's no mapping between a particular byte and a character in the encoding we're using to read our byte string in and they look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "����������\n",
    "\n",
    "Character encoding mismatches are less common today than they used to be, but it's definitely still a problem. There are lots of different character encodings, but the main one we need to know is UTF-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "UTF-8 is the standard text encoding. All Python code is in UTF-8 and, ideally, all our data should be as well. It's when things aren't in UTF-8 that we run into trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main data types we'll encounter when working with text in Python 3. One is is the string, which is what text is by default."
